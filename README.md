NKO Resume - Aashay Desai
===========

Hi!  This is my NKO resume.  I'm using this to tell you a little bit about myself so you can decide whether or not we'd be a good fit together for Node Knockout.  If you'd like to tell me more about yourself, you can fork this!

About me 
-------------
I'm a software engineer in Quality on the Salesforce.com API team by day, and a co-founder of AnonyMou.se by night.  I use Node.JS for the latter and I'm always looking to improve my NodeFu.  I've been using Node.JS for about 6 months.

I graduated in 2007 from the University of Illinois with a BS in General Engineering, and did a stint at a consulting company before my current job.

I live in San Francisco and I love music.

Projects
-----------
* [AnonyMou.se](http://anonymou.se) - Mentoring platform (code is private at the moment)
* [StreamForce](https://github.com/AashaySFDC/StreamForce) - tiny demo for Force.com Streaming API (Cometd/Bayeux API), still in progress
* [Hack For Change/AnonyMouse](https://github.com/hackforchange/AnonyMouse) - SMS based demo of AnonyMouse, 2nd place winner at Change.org's [Hack For Change](http://hackforchange.com) hackathon
* [Random Stuff on GitHub](http://github.com/aashay) - A few random things including a couple of tiny Ruby projects

Node stuff I've used: 
------------
* Mongoose - ORM for MongoDB
* Socket.IO -  The realtime framework we all know and love...
* NowJS - An interesting RPC abstraction on top of Socket.IO
* Faye - Bayeux Pub/sub for Node
* ExpressJS - Popular web microframework
* Connect - Middleware framework for Node (used in Express) 
* Restler - Rest client
* bcrypt - Blowfish encrpytion for passwords
* oauth - Oauth lib
* EJS - Templating syntax similar to Ruby on Rails' ERB

Other stuff I've used
-----------------
* APIS: Twilio, Force.com, MongoLabs
* Databases: MongoDb, MySQL (although it's been a while)
* Frontend: MooTools, jQuery (although I prefer the former)
* Misc Tools: Git/GitHub (duh), CampFire, Pivotal Tracker, 
 
Stuff I want to try
-----------
* Redis (planning on using this for a current project but haven't gotten around to it)
* Riak (exploring this as an alternative to MongoDB)
* CoffeeScript (already reading the book)
* Twitter/Facebook/GitHub APIs (I love APIs.)

Ideas I'm interested in
----------
I like working on web apps with real-time components that are useful to people.   I have a vague social-ish app idea that I need to hash out a bit more.

I think it might be cool to make a music-related app (as in, making music, not finding it). 

I'd love to make a game but I don't have a lot of UI development experience.  I love games though!

About You
------------
I love to work with great designers.  I'm pretty UX focused so I'll do whatever it takes to make sure my users are happy.  

If you're a designer looking for developers or a developer interested in what you see here, let's get in touch!

Also, if you have an existing team and you could use some more help, lets talk!
